# Datasets Template
A template to upload your analytics created using the available datasets on Strata Scratch.

## Repo Folder/File Structure
1. Name your repo anything you'd like but make sure to include the table name for reference. For example, if you analyzed datasets.yelp_reviews, then your repo might be called "An analysis of yelp_reviews".
2. The README.md file is where your questions, code, links to visualizations, and answers are stored. At a minimum, it should include:
    * the names of the database table(s) being analyzed
    * a description of the dataset
    * questions and analytical topics
    * code
    * visualizations
3. Save your code in a file with the proper extension
   * filename.sql for SQL code
   * filename.py for python code
4. Save your graphs in a folder named "visualizations". Visualizations should be linked to the README.md.
